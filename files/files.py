# A function can call itself safely because Python keeps track of the arguments and local variables in each
# running instance of the function, even if one is called from another. In this case, when split_fully calls
# itself, the outer (first) instance doesn â€™ t lose its value of nameeven though the inner (second) instance
# assigns a different value to it, because each has its own copy of the variable name. When the inner
# instance returns, the outer instance continues with the same variable values it had when it made the
# recursive call.

# def test(parm):
#     print(parm)
#     if (parm == 0):
#         return 0
#     else:
#         return test(parm - 1)
#
# print(test(2))
